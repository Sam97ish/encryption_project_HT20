 As there are to many characters to test them all. You need to think about how many cases you need to safe-guard.

I think only two cases are needed to document the behavior

    one with special characters
    one without special characters

I would try a couple different characters and combinations when doing exploratory testing sessions, but not create test-scripts for a lot of cases. It possible to add more cases in the future if they are found to be giving problems
